# Automated_Watering_System_YM
An Arduino-based automated irrigation system that monitors soil moisture and controls a water pump through a relay. When the soil is dry, the pump activates automatically and stops once optimal moisture is reached. Demonstrates embedded control, sensor integration, and basic automation principles.
